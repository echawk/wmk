This document will provide a high level overview of my website
management situation, should you want to use this sytem yourself.

The key idea behind this system is portability. It doesn't require
any gigantic dependencies, just simple C programs and shell scripts.
(NOTE: You can also depend on LaTeX, which admittedly isn't simple or small.)

Additionally, the main make script also allows you to export your
site as a tarball for easy distribution on different computers -
in addition to serving as an easy method of backing up the site.

The supported formats for site files are:
* Markdown
* LaTeX
* ORG (todo) but this will be used for programming style blog entries
  (orrr I could just use marktex.................)

Plain text isn't supported.

I am considering moving the markdown generator to use my homegrown
`marktex' but I haven't touched that project in about a year so I'm
not familiar with it's edge cases anymore. That should be relatively
straightforward to do though.

NOTE: I may also just rewrite marktex to use a different language
altogether, however there are few languages as convient as shell for the
use case.

The general layout is as follows:

.
├── about.md
├── dir-make
├── make
├── subdir1
│   ├── about.md
│   └── article-topic.md
├── subdir2
│   ├── about.md
│   └── article-topic2.tex
└── style.css

To build the website, run `./make' in the root of the site.
This will automatically link up the style.css files as well as the
`make' scripts that are used to compile the md and latex files into
html.

The Index page and Home pages for each subdirectory are automatically generated.
Each subdirectory **must** have an about.md file in it -- it can be empty if
you'd like.

Nearly all of your visual configuration will be done in style.css

TODO: need to support the loading of assets. - Done
